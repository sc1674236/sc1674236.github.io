# About Me
Hello! I am [SC].

  After school I like to relax and sometimes a little afterwards I got to the gym when I can or workout. I am also interested in playing basketball, mainly for fun. Two goals I have for this year is to even my muscles out and to keep good grades. Another interest I sometimes do is go for walks to get out.
  One career I take some interest in is construction work, to go to construction manager. I like it because of the money that could be made; seems like a job I might be good in because of the physical work, being out, being told what to do with instructions. I believe my collaboration, communication, and time managment skils from this course will all be useful for the career I chose.
